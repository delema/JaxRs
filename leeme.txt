crear un repositorio en HitHub.

On your machine, first you will need to navigate to the project folder using git bash. When you get there you do:

git init

which initiates a new git repository in that directory.

When you've done that, you need to register that new repo with a remote (where you'll upload -- push -- your files to), 
which in this case will be github. You'll get the correct URL from your repo on GitHub.

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/[reponame].git

You need to add you existing files to your local commit:

git add .   # this adds all the files

Then you need to make an initial commit, so you do:

git commit -a -m "Initial commit" # this stages your files locally for commit. 
                                  # they haven't actually been pushed yet

Now you've created a commit in your local repo, but not in the remote one. To put it on the remote, you do the second line you posted:

git push -u origin --all

Adding the Steps here.

    Right click on your eclipse project -> Team -> Share project

    Choose git from the list shown; check the box asking create or use repository 
    -> click on create repository and click finish. - This will create a local git repo. (Assuming you already have git installed )

    Right click on project -> Team -> Commit - Select only the files you want to commit
    - Añadir al índice (stage)
    - Click on Commit. 
    - Now the files are committed to your local repo.

    Go to git repositories view in eclipse ( or Team -> Show in repositories View)

    Expand the git repository of your project and Right click on Remotes 
    
    -> Create Remote

    Remote name will appear as origin, select 'Configure Push' Option and click Ok

    In the next dialog, click on change next to URI textbox and give your git url, username, password and click on 'Save and Push'.
    
    https://github.com/delema/JaxRs.git
    
    This configures git Push.

    For configuring Fetch, go to Git Repositories -> Remote -> Configure Fetch -> Add -> Master Branch -> Next -> Finish -> Save and Fetch

    For configuring Master Branch, Branch -> Local -> Master Branch -> Right click and configure branch -> Remote: origin and Upstream Branch : refs/heads/master -> click ok

On refreshing your repo, you will be able to see the files you committed and you can do push and pull from repo.
